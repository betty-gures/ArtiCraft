# Part 1: Scoping


## Idea

With a mechanic involving both hands (palms facing each other, and adjusting the distance between both hands), the user shall be able to create primitive geometric gameobjects (for example, spheres, cubes cylinders of different sizes, size is defined by the player through the creation mechanic).

By placing the created objects in 3D space, the player creates artistic spaces and experiences. 

## Features

**Core features:** 

These are the features that your prototype really needs to function or to prove your point.

- The user shall create primitive 3D objects
- Some way of choosing the primitive
- The user shall decide on the size of the objects (core mechanic)
- The user shall place objects as they desire
- The user shall be able to position the pieces in the 3D space (glue or create them in right spot)
- The system shall offer color pallets to the users
- Objects shall appear with an initial color, assigned randomly according to the chosen color pallet

**Stretch goals:** 

These are features that are nice to have, and that you might implement if you have extra time, or in the future.

- The user shall be able to paint objects, with a paintball weapon
- The user shall be able to walk over small objects (creating stairs with smaller boxes)
- The user shall add sound that can be added to objects (as player moves through the space they may hear the audio play).
- The user shall add lights, change lights, change skybox colors within gameplay
- The user shall add particles within gameplay
- The system shall have a nice ui and ux, that is easy to navigate
- There can be a free mode, in addition to the color pallet sugestions
