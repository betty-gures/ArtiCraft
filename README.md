# ArtiCraft
VR tool for making art

# Week 1 - “*********************************************Tool for making art*********************************************”

# Part 1: Scoping

**(This should be completed every Thursday 8:30 am PT)**

## Idea

I want to extend the **Stack a Cube** assignment in the Foundations course. 

With a similar mechanic, the user shall be able to create other game objects as well 

(for example, spheres, cubes cylinders of different sizes, size is defined by the player through the creation mechanic).

By sticking the created objects to the wall, the player creates art or even different new spaces. 

Like brick and mortar, there could be a glue element that would make game objects stick together. 

The player could even walk on the created objects. 

There could be paint boxes to change the colors, or a weapon to shoot paintballs.

## Features

**Core features:** 

These are the features that your prototype really needs to function or to prove your point.

- The user shall create primitive 3D objects
- Some way of choosing the primitive
- The user shall decide on the size of the objects (core mechanic)
- The user shall place objects as they desire
- The user shall be able to position the pieces in the 3D space (glue or create them in right spot)
- The system shall offer color pallets to the users
- Objects shall appear with an initial color, assigned randomly according to the chosen color pallet

**Stretch goals:** 

These are features that are nice to have, and that you might implement if you have extra time, or in the future.

- The user shall be able to paint objects, with a paintball weapon
- The user shall be able to walk over small objects (creating stairs with smaller boxes)
- The user shall add sound that can be added to objects (as player moves through the space they may hear the audio play).
- The user shall add lights, change lights, change skybox colors within gameplay
- The user shall add particles within gameplay
- The system shall have a nice ui and ux, that is easy to navigate
- There can be a free mode, in addition to the color pallet sugestions

# Part 2: Prototype

[Kanban Board](https://www.notion.so/Kanban-Board-2e83ed43c3524bab9dcefd1113392fcc)

**(This should be completed every Wednesday 8:30 am PT)**

## Concept

In this section, you will write a quick explanation of the overall objective of your weekly prototype

Example:

> *A VR game room where a player can host and ask his friends to join the room. In the game room, they can play cards (free form) and play air hockey. They can see each other's avatars with their user name on them and they can also talk to each other.*
> 

## Video(s)/Material(s)

**One or more embedded videos** of your experience in VR. This will help users experience it easily if they don’t have access to VR. We recommend unlisted youtube videos for accessibility, but you can embed the videos directly on this page

Videos links should be created inside your gdrive student folder and hyperlinked here:

‘’[Student Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vUpGwwDXDexvlc_XT9OIRYt-qpqTgzLw?usp=sharing)’’

## Key Learning Points

What did you learn this week?
What would you have done differently?

## Git Repository Link

We strongly recommend your experience is stored in Git. This will aid in storage and development  + it’s an easy way to centralize your information
